# **[POWER BI] HR ANALYTICS CASE STUDY**

## I. Introduction
  ### 1. Introduction to Dataset:
  XYZ INC. is facing a high attrition rate among their employees which in turn negatively affects their business due to 
  
- The project of the former employee is progressing slowly, making it difficult to complete on schedule, weakening their position
- Need to maintain a large department to recruit new talent
- New employees must be trained on the job and have time to get acquainted with the company.
  
Therefore, the management has contracted a data analytics company to understand what factors they should focus on to reduce attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to keep the most employees. Additionally, they want to know which issues are the most important and should be addressed immediately.
